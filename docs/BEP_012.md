## Abstract

This BEP extends the metainfo file format to support lists of trackers, organized in tiers.

---

## Specification

In addition to the standard `announce` key, a new key `announce-list` is added to the metainfo file (not inside the `info` dictionary).

### Structure

```
announce-list = [ [ tracker1 ], [ backup1 ], [ backup2 ] ]
                OR
announce-list = [ [ tracker1, tracker2, tracker3 ] ]
                OR
announce-list = [ [ tracker1, tracker2 ], [ backup1 ] ]
```

`announce-list` is a list of lists of URLs, representing tiers of trackers.

---

## Tier Processing

### Order

1. Tiers are processed sequentially
2. All URLs in each tier must be checked before moving to the next tier

### Within-Tier Processing

URLs within each tier are processed in random order (the list is shuffled).

### Promotion

If a connection with a tracker is successful, it is moved to the front of its tier.

---

## Tier Examples

### Example 1: Independent Trackers

```
announce-list = [ [tracker1], [backup1], [backup2] ]
```

Behavior:
- Always try tracker1 first
- If tracker1 fails, try backup1
- If backup1 fails, try backup2
- Repeat in same order on next announce

Use case: Trackers cannot share information

---

### Example 2: Load-Balanced Trackers

```
announce-list = [ [tracker1, tracker2, tracker3] ]
```

Behavior:
- Shuffle the list
- Try each in shuffled order
- On success, move successful tracker to front
- Promotes load balancing across trackers

Use case: Trackers can trade peer information

---

### Example 3: Mixed Strategy

```
announce-list = [ [tracker1, tracker2], [backup1] ]
```

Behavior:
- Tier 1: Shuffle and try both tracker1 and tracker2
- Tier 2: Try backup1 only if tier 1 fails

---

## Compatibility

If the client supports `announce-list` and it is present, the `announce` key is ignored.

For backwards compatibility, torrent creators should still include the `announce` key.
